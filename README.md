# ServerPulse

ServerPulse is an **open-source**, real-time performance monitoring tool for Paper Minecraft servers. It collects key server metrics (TPS, disk usage, memory, player count, entities, chunks, ping) and visualizes them through an integrated Grafana dashboard.

## üìñ What This Project Is

- **Goal:** Provide an extensible, lightweight plugin to gather server metrics and store them in InfluxDB for visualization with Grafana.
- **Tech stack:**
    - Java (Paper plugin) ‚Üí InfluxDB
    - Grafana dashboard (preconfigured via provisioning)
    - Discord alerts for key server metrics
    - Docker Compose (for InfluxDB & Grafana setup)

## Why Choose ServerPulse?

ServerPulse isn't just another metrics exporter - it offers several unique advantages:

* **Complete Monitoring Stack**: Fully integrated solution with InfluxDB (optimized for time-series data) and pre-configured Grafana dashboards
* **Per-World Analytics**: Track entity counts, chunk loading, and performance metrics separately for each world
* **Flexible Tagging System**: Group and filter metrics by server, network, region, or any custom dimension through simple configuration
* **Zero-Configuration Dashboards**: Auto-provisioned Grafana dashboards - no manual setup required
* **Alert Notifications**: Integrated Discord alerts for critical server metrics (TPS drops, memory issues, etc.)
* **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Built-in health checks, connection retry mechanisms, and proper error handling
* **Docker-First Deployment**: Single command deployment with Docker Compose for the entire monitoring stack
