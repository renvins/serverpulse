# ServerPulse

ServerPulse is an **open-source**, real-time performance monitoring tool for Minecraft servers. It collects key server metrics (TPS, disk usage, memory, player count, entities, chunks, ping) and visualizes them through an integrated Grafana dashboard.

## üìñ What This Project Is

- **Goal:** Provide an extensible, lightweight plugin to gather server metrics and store them in InfluxDB for visualization with Grafana.
- **Tech stack:**
    - Java (Bukkit/Paper plugin) ‚Üí InfluxDB
    - Grafana dashboard (preconfigured via provisioning)
    - Discord alerts for key server metrics
    - Docker Compose (for InfluxDB & Grafana setup)

## üåü Platform Support

ServerPulse now supports **all Minecraft server platforms** in the Bukkit ecosystem:

- **Bukkit/Spigot**: Full support with custom TPS monitoring implementation
- **Paper and its forks** (PurPur, Pufferfish, etc.): Enhanced support with native TPS monitoring

The plugin automatically detects your server platform and uses the most efficient implementation available for that environment.

## Why Choose ServerPulse?

ServerPulse isn't just another metrics exporter - it offers several unique advantages:

- **Complete Monitoring Stack**  
  Fully integrated solution with InfluxDB (optimized for time-series data) and pre-configured Grafana dashboards

- **Universal Platform Support**  
  Works with any Bukkit-based server while taking advantage of Paper-specific optimizations when available

- **Per-World Analytics**  
  Track entity counts, chunk loading, and performance metrics separately for each world

- **Flexible Tagging System**  
  Group and filter metrics by server, network, region, or any custom dimension through simple configuration

- **Zero-Configuration Dashboards**  
  Auto-provisioned Grafana dashboards - no manual setup required

- **Alert Notifications**  
  Integrated Discord and Telegram alerts for critical server metrics (TPS drops, memory issues, etc.)

- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**  
  Built-in health checks, connection retry mechanisms, and proper error handling

- **Docker-First Deployment**  
  Single command deployment with Docker Compose for the entire monitoring stack
