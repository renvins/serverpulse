# ServerPulse

ServerPulse is an **open‑source**, real‑time performance monitoring tool for Paper Minecraft servers. It will collect key server metrics (TPS, memory/CPU usage, online player count) and store them in InfluxDB for visualization in Grafana.

> ⚠️ **Work In Progress** — ServerPulse is under active development toward its **v0.1.0** inaugural release. It is **not yet runnable**, but contributions are welcome!

## 📖 What This Project Is

- **Goal:** Provide an extensible, lightweight plugin to gather server metrics and expose them via a time‑series database + dashboard  
- **Tech stack (planned MVP):**  
  - Java (Paper plugin) → InfluxDB  
  - Grafana dashboard (preconfigured)
