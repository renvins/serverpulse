# ServerPulse

ServerPulse is an open-source, real-time performance monitoring tool for Minecraft servers. It collects key server metrics (TPS, MSPT, disk usage, memory, player count, entities, chunks, ping) and visualizes them through an integrated Grafana dashboard.

## üöÄ Why Choose ServerPulse?

ServerPulse isn't just another metrics exporter - it offers several unique advantages:

-   **Complete Monitoring Stack** - Fully integrated solution with InfluxDB (optimized for time-series data) and pre-configured Grafana dashboards.
-   **Universal Platform Support** - Works with any Bukkit-based, Velocity, and Fabric server while taking advantage of Paper-specific optimizations when available.
-   **Per-World Analytics** - Track entity counts, chunk loading, and performance metrics separately for each world.
-   **Flexible Tagging System** - Group and filter metrics by server, network, region, or any custom dimension through simple configuration.
-   **Zero-Configuration Dashboards** - Auto-provisioned Grafana dashboards, no manual setup required.
-   **Alert Notifications** - Integrated Discord and Telegram alerts for critical server metrics (TPS drops, memory issues, etc.).
-   **Production-Ready Infrastructure** - Built-in health checks, connection retry mechanisms, and proper error handling.
-   **Docker-First Deployment** - Single command deployment with Docker Compose for the entire monitoring stack.

## üåü Platform Support

ServerPulse supports **all Minecraft server platforms** in the ecosystem:

-   **Bukkit/Spigot**: Full support with custom TPS monitoring implementation.
-   **Paper and its forks** (Purpur, Pufferfish, etc.): Enhanced support with native TPS monitoring.
-   **BungeeCord**: Support for BungeeCord proxy servers with network-wide player monitoring.
-   **Velocity**: Support for Velocity proxy servers (ofc TPS and world metrics are not available).
-   **Fabric**: Support for Fabric servers (latest versions of Fabric API and Minecraft).

The plugin automatically detects your server platform and uses the most efficient implementation available for that environment.
